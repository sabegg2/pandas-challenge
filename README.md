Module 4 Challenge

The PyCitySchools.ipynb is my completed notebook submission. It runs without error and generates all of the required output. The outputs match those in the Bootcamp Spot description of the Challenge.

I wrote the code entirely on my own without collaboration or any online AI source (although Google was occasionally helpful for syntax). Several of the methods and techniques we learned in class.

We were also requested to draw at least two conclusions off of the data and submit a report with these conclusions. It was not clear whether this report was to be a separate document or could be put in the notebook file, so I did both. The pdf file (PandasChallengeReport.pdf) contains these conclusions, and the same conclusions are at the top of the PyCitySchools.ipynb notebook file.
