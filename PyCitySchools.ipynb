    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Module 4 Challenge: \"You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this challenge, we were given two datasets. One was a list of schools in a certain district (columns: school ID, school name, type, size, and budget). The other was a list of students at these schools (columns: student ID, student name, gender, grade, school name, reading score, and math score). We were asked to join these tables and create some summary tables ranking the schools by student performance and tabulating the around the number of students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and percent passing math and reading and both. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- The following notebook was developed from the provided starter code.\n",

    "- # Some Conclusions from the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  We were asked to draw at least two conclusions about the data from the output of the analysis. Here are four conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  (1) The average math scores (and % passing math) are less than the average reading scores (and % passing reading) for all schools (Charter and District) and for all grades. This indicates a general trend that students struggle more at math than at reading. The percentage passing is relatively static for all grade levels at any given school, indicating that there is no improvement or decline with grade level.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (2) In general, the students at Charter schools perform better than students at District schools, in both math and reading. The five highest performing schools (by % overall passing) are all Charter and the five lowest performing schools (by % overall passing) are all District. The overall passing rate of Charter schools is 90.4% while the overall passing rate of District schools is 53.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (3) Counterintuitively, the results show that, in general, increasing school budget per student does not increase performance, in either math or reading. Highest average math and reading scores are actually seen at the lowest budget rnage of <585 dollars and the lowest average math and reading scores are seen at the highest budget range of 645-680 dollars. The reason for this result is that government-funded District schools have a higher budget than privately-funded Charter schools, and as mentioned above, District schools show a significantly lower performance than Charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "  (4) Performance increases as school size deceases. This is evidenced by the fact the schools with <1000 students have the highest average math and reading scores and passing rates and large schools 2000-5000 students have the lowest average math and reading scores and passing rates. Like performance and budget, performance and size can be correlated with the type of school, since District schools (which have lower performance) tend to be larger in size than Charter schools (which have higher performance)..\r\n",
